#### 路The main code for the project is stored in the "An_Microchip_Object_Detection_System_Based_On_Tensorflow2_EfficientDet_model.ipynb" file.
#### 路The project was carried out as early as 2020, and some of the tools may not be compatible with today's Python toolkit versions. 
#### 路The code can be run on Jupyter Notebook, but due to version issues, there is no guarantee that each step will be successfully completed.
#### 路But you can still click the button "open in colab"  to see the process details and results saved while the project was running.
