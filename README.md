1.The main code for the project is stored in the "An_Microchip_Object_Detection_System_Based_On_Tensorflow2_EfficientDet_model.ipynb" file.

2.The project was carried out as early as 2020, and some of the tools may not be compatible with today's Python toolkit versions. The code can be run on Jupyter Notebook, but due to version issues, there is no guarantee that each step will be successfully completed.

3.But you can still click the orange button "open in colab" before the contents of the "An_Microchip_Object_Detection_System_Based_On_Tensorflow2_EfficientDet_model.ipynb" file to see the process details and results saved while the project was running.
